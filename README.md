# ðŸ’… Nail Art Recommendation Web App

A web application that curates a wide range of nail art styles and helps users explore, filter, collect, and receive personalized recommendations powered by machine learning.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Scope

This project aims to build a web application that collects and organizes a wide range of nail art styles from the internet. Users will be able to browse, search, filter, and save nail art designs, while receiving personalized recommendations powered by a lightweight machine learning model.

The scope focuses on front-end feature development, tag-based filtering, user interaction logging, and basic personalization. Raw image-based recognition is excluded due to complexity and low return on effort.

## ðŸ‘¤ Target Users

The intended users are:

- **Nail art enthusiasts** looking for inspiration and references  
- **Nail artists/designers** who want to explore trends and organize style references  
- **Casual users** interested in trying new nail art styles  

These users seek a simple yet powerful way to find styles that match their personal preferences based on visual features like color, shape, and occasion.

## âœ¨ Features

The application will include the following core features:

- Display of nail art images sourced from the internet or datasets  
- Tag-based filters: shape, color, occasion  
- User interactions: like, collect  
- Search bar with history tracking  
- Personalized feed based on user interactions (likes, search terms, collections)

## ðŸ›  Development Setup

### Virtual Environment Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment** when you're done:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
