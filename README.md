# ðŸ’… Nail Art Recommendation Static Web App

A static web application that curates a wide range of nail art styles and helps users explore, filter, and collect designs locally in their browser.

---

## âœ¨ Features

The application currently includes the following features:

- **Image Gallery:** Display of nail art images loaded from a local data source (`tags.json`). Supports client-side pagination (loading more images on demand).
- **Tag-based Filtering:** Filter images based on **multiple selections** of Nail Shape, Style, and Color tags using a sidebar filter UI.
- **Search:** Search images by name or tags (client-side).
- **Client-side Collections:** Users can collect (save) nail art images directly in their browser using `localStorage`. A separate Collections page displays the user's locally saved items.
- **Interactive Elements:** Save/bookmark button on images to add/remove from local collections. Filter toggle button to open/close the sidebar.
- **Navigation:** Fixed header with navigation links (Home, Collections).

## ðŸ“Š Data Source

Image data and tags are stored in the static file `tags.json`. This file is generated by the `generate_tags_clip.py` script, which fetches images (up to 100) using the Unsplash API and classifies them using the CLIP model.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project is designed for static website hosting. It is well-suited for deployment on platforms like **Azure Static Web Apps**, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

To deploy to Azure Static Web Apps:

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  In the Azure portal, create a new Static Web App resource.
3.  Connect your GitHub repository.
4.  Configure the build details:
    *   **Build Preset:** `Custom`
    *   **App location:** `/` (or the root directory if your index.html is there)
    *   **Api location:** (Leave empty, as there is no API)
    *   **Output location:** `/` (or the directory containing your index.html and static assets)
5.  Azure will automatically set up a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.

    ```
3.  **Generate `tags.json` (optional, if you need to update images):**
    ```bash
    python generate_tags_clip.py
    ```
4.  **Preview Locally:** Use a simple HTTP server.
