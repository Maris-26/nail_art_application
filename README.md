## 💅 Naily – Developer Project Plan

### 🎯 Project Scope  
This project aims to build a web application that curates a wide variety of nail art designs and recommends personalized styles based on user interactions. Inspired by platforms like Red Note and beauty e-commerce filters, the app will use a fixed tag system (e.g., color, shape, season) to support search and recommendations. Machine learning will operate on user behavior data—such as searches, likes, and collections—to deliver personalized content. Tag vectors (not image data) will be the foundation of all ML logic. The system will also log interaction-tag pairs to enable future trend dashboards. Copyright is not a concern due to the non-commercial, educational nature of this project.

### 👥 Target Users  
The app targets three main groups:
- Nail art lovers looking for style inspiration  
- Casual users interested in trying new nail styles  
- Nail artists and designers seeking references  
All users will benefit from efficient filtering and personalized recommendations tailored to their style preferences and seasonal occasions.
